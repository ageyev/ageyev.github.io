On the other hand, Israel\u2019s opponents accuse it of striving to seize the corresponding territories.\\n\\nHowever, this interpretation does not align with the biblical text.

And for the western border, ye shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your west border. And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea ye shall mark out your line unto mount Hor; from mount Hor ye shall mark out a line unto the entrance to Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your north border. And ye shall mark out your line for the east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham; and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall strike upon the slope of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea; this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.\\n\\nWhich roughly corresponds to the current borders of Israel: on the western side is the Mediterranean Sea (\\"the Great Sea\\"), on the eastern side is the Jordan, the Sea of Galilee (Chinnereth) and the Dead (Salt) Sea, on the south are the deserts of the Sinai or Arabian Peninsula (\\"the desert of Sin\\"), and on the north is the southern part of present-day Syria.\\n\\n![\\"From the Nile to the Euphrates\\"](/img/Illustrations/blog/2025-02-06-from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates/Bereshit_15-18.png)\\n\\n--- \\n\\nthis post in: \\n\\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvBBNkoYaM/) \\n\\n[Twitter](https://x.com/ageyev/status/1887506345617768538)\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid0GqkDefYN7YKmHdi1tzLC7Ai1vcoRvH2CqdSvhZS2yfhKfMM3SA1rf9yGWHm8yivTl) (discussion in Russian)\\n\\n--- \\n\\nSee also: \\n\\n[Where Are Israel\'s Borders and What Is Israel Actually Occupying]( /Holy-Land/borders_and_territory_of_israel)"},{"id":"october7","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/october7","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-07-october-7/index.md","title":"October 7","description":"This is the text of my eldest son, written a week after October 7th.

My story that I went through, and with great luck, I am now able to write these words.\\n\\n**October 7th**, a day we woke up to the announcement of a \\"Red Alert\\" throughout the entire sector. We were in the shelter, and no one paid too much attention to these missiles, because what can they really do besides a few rockets...\\n\\nWe heard gunfire from the direction of a nearby base, and within a few minutes, our gear was on us, and we headed in that direction. From that moment, we entered the war. It\'s impossible to describe the feelings you go through during this. You stop thinking and feeling; you just do what you need to do. You strive, advance, and shoot\u2014all in a combat zone unfamiliar to you, all while rockets whistle overhead.\\n\\nAnd then comes the moment when I get hit by the bullet. At that moment, I felt nothing; I looked at my leg and couldn\'t believe this was happening. From here, everything happened in seconds. Seconds in which they take you back, apply a tourniquet, and tell you that everything will be okay. It all happened in seconds\u2014seconds that replay themselves in my head for entire days.\\n\\nI can\'t describe my pride toward my friends from Unit 414 who fought and destroyed the enemy in that battle. I love you, and you will always remain in my heart as the bravest people I\'ve ever known, each and every one of you. You are my heroes and heroines, and I\'m proud to have fought alongside you.\\n\\nI have never felt more pain than the pain over those who fell. I still can\'t grasp the number of people who were taken from this world\u2014and all in one day. Everyone I know lost someone: a friend, a family member, a brother, or a sister. Each one of them is etched on the heart of each of us forever. No one will be forgotten.\\n\\n*\\"Whoever is merciful to the cruel will end up being cruel to the merciful.\\"*\\n\\n--- \\n\\n[Publication on the website of Channel 9 of Israeli television](https://www.9tv.co.il/Item/79640) (In Russian)\\n\\n[Publication on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid0AzoFkvcVD9ka8bMTDJDAzg3YKU2asgU6Prg13G3QT8Wsm3nzue477pjx4zUqyC5Xl) (in Russian)"},{"id":"starting","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/starting","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-06-start/index.md","title":"Starting","description":"Welcome to the new blog.","date":"2024-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Viktor Ageyev","permalink":"/blog/tags/ageyev","description":"Viktor Ageyev"},{"inline":false,"label":"Test","permalink":"/blog/tags/Test","description":"Publication for testing website features"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Ageyev","title":"author","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/ageyev"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/ageyev","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ageyev/","github":"https://github.com/ageyev"},"imageURL":"/img/authors/ageyev_viktor_02.jpg","key":"ageyev"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"starting","title":"Starting","authors":["ageyev"],"tags":["ageyev","test"],"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"October 7","permalink":"/blog/october7"}},"content":"Welcome to the new blog. \\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e \\n\\nIt was build with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework, its code is hosted on GitHub, see [repo](https://github.com/ageyev/ageyev.github.io/)"}]}}')}}]);
