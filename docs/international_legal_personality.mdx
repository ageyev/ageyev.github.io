# International legal personality

"International legal personality" refers to the capacity of an entity to possess rights and obligations under international law and to engage in international relations.

## Proper use of the term

You can find a statement like this:

> "most textbooks contain chapters on international personality or on the subjects of international law, the two expressions mostly used as synonyms"

(Roland Portmann [Legal Personality in International Law](https://www.cambridge.org/il/universitypress/subjects/law/public-international-law/legal-personality-international-law), Cambridge University Press, November 2013. See [excerpt](https://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/68450/excerpt/9780521768450_excerpt.pdf))

But this means only that two terms refer to the same topic. "International legal personality" refers to the capacity of an entity to possess rights and obligations under international law and to engage in international relations. It is something that a state *has*, not something a state *is*.

In proper usage, you would say that a state has international legal personality. This means the state has the legal capacity to enter into treaties, participate in international organizations, and be held accountable under international law. States are the primary entities that possess international legal personality, but international organizations and, in some cases, individuals may also have it to varying degrees.

Althouth you may find a usage of this therm like this:

> "... the extinction of the State as a legal personality recognized in the international order must be shown before its rights and obligations can be considered thereby to have ceased to exist"
