# "From the Nile to the Euphrates": On the Question of Israel’s Biblical Borders

One of the debated issues when discussing Israel’s borders from a legal perspective (in our view, sacred texts should also be considered in international law) is the well-known phrase *"from the Nile to the Euphrates,"* understood as the Tanakhic (biblical) definition of Israel’s borders.

Accordingly, on one hand, some Israelis believe that Israel’s borders should be expanded to the "Torah-defined" boundaries from the Nile to the Euphrates. On the other hand, Israel’s opponents accuse it of striving to seize the corresponding territories.

However, this interpretation does not align with the biblical text. This passage is truly remarkable, considering the time it was written. That is, it was written thousands of years ago, and today it has come to pass as foretold. 

No, Israel's borders do not extend from the Nile to the Euphrates, nor should they. In reality, this is not about the borders of Israel.

It was written as follows (Bereshit/Genesis [15:18](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm)):

> בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא, כָּרַת יְהוָה אֶת-אַבְרָם--בְּרִית לֵאמֹר: לְזַרְעֲךָ, נָתַתִּי אֶת-הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת, מִנְּהַר מִצְרַיִם, עַד-הַנָּהָר הַגָּדֹל נְהַר-פְּרָת.

(On that day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying: "To your descendants I give these lands, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates")

In the King James translation:

> In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.'

The descendants of Abraham are not only the Jews but also the Arabs.

Thus, indeed, in the present time, as foretold, the lands from the Nile to the Euphrates are owned by the descendants of Abraham.
