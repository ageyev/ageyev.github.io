# Remembrance Day 

These are the words of a commander in one of the combat units of the IDF 🇮🇱 on Memorial Day. The words of my son. I think this should be published. The translation into English is mine, below is the original in Hebrew.

On this Memorial Day, I stand before the names that no longer have a voice.<br/>
Before the faces that are burned into my memory as if they were here yesterday.<br/>
Brothers and sisters along the way, in the war, in the dreams.<br/>

They were the ones who walked with me on the battlefield,<br/>
With whom we tore apart the lines of fear - and the lines of hope.<br/>

And when my wound tried to overcome my body,<br/>
They were already there - wrapped in a silence,<br/>
That I will never forget.<br/>

I came back to fight - not only for myself.<br/>
I came back for them.<br/>
Because each one who fell left me a silent testament:<br/>
To continue,<br/>
Raise the flag with aching hands,<br/>
And to keep going - even when my heart is heavy.<br/>

On this day, when the siren cuts through the sky,<br/>
I close my eyes - and I see them:<br/>
Laughter on duty,<br/>
An anxious look on the last night,<br/>
Promises that we did not have time to make - and that were broken.<br/>

They cannot be measured by numbers, or names on obelisks.<br/>

They live in me,<br/>
Breathe in me.<br/>
They are an integral part of who I am today.<br/>
And each of us.<br/>

On this Memorial Day, I promise:<br/>
I will not forget.<br/>

ביום הזיכרון הזה — אני עומד מול שמות שאין להם עוד קול.<br/>
מול פרצופים שצרובים בזיכרוני, כאילו היו כאן אתמול.<br/>
אחים ואחיות לדרך, לחזית, לחלום.<br/>

הם היו אלה שהלכו איתי בשדות האש,<br/>
שפרצו יחד איתי את קווי הפחד — ואת קווי התקווה.<br/>
וכשפציעתי ניסתה להכריע את גופי,<br/>
הם כבר שכבו שם — עטופים בשקט,<br/>
שלא אוכל לשכוח לעולם.<br/>

חזרתי להילחם — לא רק בעבורי.<br/>
חזרתי בשבילם.<br/>
כי כל מי שנפל, השאיר לי צוואה חרישית:<br/>
להמשיך.<br/>
להרים את הדגל בידיים כואבות,<br/>
ולהמשיך לצעוד — גם כשהלב כבד.<br/>

ביום הזה, כשהצפירה חותכת את השמיים,<br/>
אני עוצם עיניים — ורואה אותם:<br/>
את הצחוק במוצב,<br/>
את המבט המתרגש בלילה האחרון,<br/>
את ההבטחות שלא הספקנו לתת — ושנשברו.<br/>

הם לא נמדדים במספרים, ולא רק בשמות על קירות הזיכרון.<br/>
הם חיים בתוכי.<br/>
נושמים בי.<br/>
היום, חלק בלתי נפרד מכל מה שאני.<br/>
ומכל אחד ואחת מאיתנו.<br/>

ביום הזיכרון הזה, אני לא שוכח.<br/>
אני מבטיח.<br/>
