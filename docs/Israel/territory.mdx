# Where Are the Borders of Israel, and What Does Israel Actually Occupy?

## Applicable Principles of International Law

The reasoning in this text is based on principles which, despite their apparent simplicity and obviousness, when applied to the situation under review, lead to conclusions contrary to the prevailing positions found in most UN documents and even the rulings of the Israeli Supreme Court.

These principles are as follows:

1. The territory of a state is the area within its borders.
2. A border treaty between neighboring states determines the border line between them.
3. Occupation refers only to the military presence of a state’s armed forces on territory beyond its borders.
4. Even a strong desire to establish a state on the territory of another state does not make that territory "occupied."

Each of these principles should be considered as "the general principle of law recognized by civilized nations" as this term is are used in Article 38(1) of the [Statute of the International Court of Justice](https://www.icj-cij.org/statute).

Our experience in discussions among legal experts reveal that even staunch opponents of Israel cannot dispute the validity of these four principles. Applying them to the question of Israel's borders, while considering relevant international agreements, leads to the conclusion that both the Gaza Strip and what UN documents refer to as "the West Bank, including East Jerusalem," are unequivocally part of Israel's territory. They are neither "occupied" nor "[disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_dispute)."

Let us analyze this issue in greater detail and address the question of what Israel actually occupies.

## Historical Background

### The UN Partition Plan for Palestine and the So-Called "1947 Borders"

From 1922, the territory of Palestine (including modern-day Jordan) was governed by Great Britain under the [Mandate of the League of Nations](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Palestine_Mandate_(1922)), which explicitly stated that this territory was entrusted to Britain for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people."



On September 16, 1922, the [Transjordan Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_Memorandum) excluded the area of present-day Jordan from the territories designated for Jewish settlement. On May 25, 1946, the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan became an independent state.

On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 ["Future Government of Palestine"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_181), recommending the creation of two independent states—one Arab and one Jewish—within the remaining territory of Palestine under British administration.

In discussions about current events, some claim that Israel is an occupying force because it holds territory designated for the Arab state under this resolution. For instance, the relevant Wikipedia article [Arab-Israeli War (1947–1949)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931949_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War) quotes a UN document [Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem](https://www.un.org/unispal/origins-and-evolution-of-the-palestine-problem/part-i-1917-1947/) stating:

> "As a result of the war, about half of the territories allocated for the Arab state and West Jerusalem were occupied by Israel."

This assertion is incorrect.

The Arab side formally rejected the resolution. On May 15, 1948, the day after Israel declared independence, the League of Arab States launched a war against Israel, involving Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Yemen.

After losing the war, and failing to destroy Israel militarily, some on the defeated side adopted a new stance: "Let us now recognize the UN resolution." However, recognition would have been relevant in 1947, not after the crushing defeat in 1967.

The cited UN resolution, though recommendatory in nature and inconsistent with the original goals of the Palestine Mandate, was recognized by Israel in its [Declaration of Independence](https://main.knesset.gov.il/ru/about/pages/declaration.aspx). It ceased to hold relevance after May 15, 1948, when the Arab states rejected it and initiated hostilities. Therefore, any subsequent Arab demands to treat the resolution as a basis for territorial borders are legally untenable.

### The "Green Line" and the "Pre-1967 Borders"

In 1949, under UN auspices, armistice agreements were signed between Israel and the neighboring aggressor states (except Iraq), establishing the lines of ceasefire ([1949 Armistice Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements)). These demarcation lines, known as the [Green Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)), diverged significantly from the borders proposed in the 1947 UN Resolution. The Gaza Strip was seized by Egypt, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank were incorporated into Jordan.

These borders were effectively recognized until the [Six-Day War of 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War).

Although some international documents refer to these as the "pre-1967 borders," they represented not the division between two states but between three: Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

## Modern Borders and Israel’s Territory

### The Gaza Strip and the Israel-Egypt Border

The [Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty of 1979](https://peacemaker.un.org/egyptisrael-peacetreaty79) established the recognized international border between Israel and Egypt as it existed during the British Mandate, affirming it as inviolable. The treaty clarified that Israel has no obligations regarding the Gaza Strip other than participating in negotiations for possible self-governance, as outlined in supplementary agreements.

Thus, the Gaza Strip, previously part of Egypt, lies within Israel's borders.

### Judea and Samaria (the "West Bank") and Jerusalem, and the Israel-Jordan Border

The [1994 Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty](https://peacemaker.un.org/israeljordan-peacetreaty94) established the Jordan River as the border between Israel and Jordan. The treaty explicitly stated that the line was an "administrative boundary" between Jordan and territory "under Israeli military government control since 1967." It did not confer any sovereign status on the territory beyond recognizing it as lying west of the Jordan River.

Accordingly, the territory to the west of the Jordan River is part of Israel, as confirmed by the treaty.

### Oslo Accords and Territorial Self-Governance

The [Oslo II Accord](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israeli-palestinian-interim-agreement) of 1995 did not alter the boundaries established by Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan. Instead, it provided a framework for Palestinian self-governance within Israel’s territory. The agreement explicitly prohibited unilateral actions to alter the status of the West Bank or Gaza before the conclusion of final status negotiations.

Attempts by the Palestinian Authority to unilaterally declare statehood violate the Oslo Accords.

### Annexation and Occupation

Under international law, **annexation** is defined as the unilateral incorporation of territory belonging to another state without its consent. Since Israel’s borders with Egypt and Jordan were established through treaties, territories transferred to Israel under these treaties cannot be considered annexed.

The [Golan Heights Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights_Law), by contrast, represents annexation, as the Heights were incorporated into Israel without Syrian consent, despite ongoing hostilities.

As for **occupation**, many international documents refer to areas such as Jerusalem and the West Bank as "occupied." However, this label often lacks legal substantiation. Occupation requires the military presence of one state on the territory of another—a condition not met where the territory is part of Israel under binding treaties.

### Conclusion

The Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria, and Jerusalem lie within Israel’s recognized borders, as established by international treaties with Egypt and Jordan. Consequently, they cannot be considered "occupied territories" under international law.
