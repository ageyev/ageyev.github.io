# Strike on Iran

In a [statement](https://x.com/IDF/status/1933324595471454495) by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) press office dated 13 June 2025, it was stated that the Israeli army had carried out a preemptive strike on Iran.

In this context, I shall provide a brief international legal clarification:

Following Iran’s massive attacks against Israel on [13–14 April 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel) and [1 October 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), today's strike on Iran cannot in any way be regarded as "preventive" or "preemptive."

It is precisely a retaliatory strike, as Israel had previously been attacked by Iran.

As early as 22 April 2024, the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations, [Gilad Erdan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Erdan), sent an official [letter](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4045365) to the UN Security Council notifying it of Iran's attack on Israel, urging the Security Council to take measures, and warning that Israel had the right to act by virtue of its right of self-defense.

The Security Council did not adopt any effective measures. Moreover, on [1 October 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), Iran conducted another massive missile attack against Israel.

On 00 October 2024, Israel’s representative to the United Nations, [Danny Danon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Danon), once again addressed the UN Security Council with a new [letter](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4063563) concerning Iran’s actions, calling upon the Security Council to take measures to resolve the situation and warning that Israel would be compelled to take measures of self-defense.

Article 51 of the [UN Charter](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7) states that Members of the United Nations possess *"the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security."*

Thus, in the absence of effective measures by the UN Security Council, bombardments of Iran by Israeli aircraft, as well as possible bombardments of Iran by Israel’s allies, constitute responsive measures in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter concerning the right of individual or collective self-defense.
