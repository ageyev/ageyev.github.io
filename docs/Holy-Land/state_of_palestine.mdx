# Equivocation, or what is a State of Palestine?

In logic, [equivocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) is a fallacy or deception resulting from calling different things by the same term within an argument.

This trick is sometimes used in applied jurisprudence, for example when the same name is used for several legal entities that may have different status (commercial or non-profit), or are registered in different jurisdictions. And, for example, some rights belonging to one legal entity (license, insurance, etc.) are used for another legal entity with the same name.

The activities of the so-called "State of Palestine" are based on the same deception, in particular its participation in the process in the International Criminal Court (case ICC-01/18 “[Situation in Palestine](https://www.icc-cpi.int/palestine)”)

And this deception consists in the fact that the term “State of Palestine” is used to refer to different entities, trying (so far successfully) to pass them off as one and the same.

So there is two different entities, which they are trying to mix:

## The State of Palestine was proclaimed in Algeria in 1988

In Algiers on November 15, 1988, [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat) announced the [Palestinian Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Palestinian_Declaration_of_Independence)

Text of the Declaratiio was approved by the Palestinian National Council.

> The Palestine National Council, in the name of God, and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people, hereby proclaims the establishment of the State of Palestine on our Palestinian territory with its capital Jerusalem (Al-Quds Ash-Sharif)
