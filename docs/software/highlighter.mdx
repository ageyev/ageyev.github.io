# Highlighter.pro

This is a Chrome extension written by me, that works as a highlighter on webpages.

I was looking for an extension with open code, that can be installed from [source code](https://github.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter) as like as from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/highlighterpro/gpdhplhmppgenpnkfilghnjiodfmnoap)(click on this link to install it), that does not collect any data from user, and, as is often the case, I ended up writing my own.

It's *very* fast, very lightweight and does not overload your browser with heavy scripts.

Here you can see how it works:
<LiteYouTubeEmbed
    id="2SCs8qEbkGI"
    title='Highlighter.pro Chrome extension'
    noCookie={false}
/>

## Functionality

* You can add (and remove) highlights on web page using browser's context menu.
* This extension uses side panel to show list of highlights and notes
* You can add or edit notes to highlights in side panel
* Notes to highlights can be written in [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). It means you can format text, add notes, task lists, code blocks etc.
* Highlights and notes can be saved to a backup file and then restored on another computer on in another Chrome browser. For this use extension's options page.
* On extension's 'options' page you can remove all your highlights and notes in current browser (it is recommended to save a backup file before)
* Code is open sourced and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter)

### How to save and restore backup

Right-click on the extension icon > choose 'options' > use corresponding buttons to save and restore backup file.
