# It must also be seen to be done

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his [address](https://farsi.khamenei.ir/speech-content?id=60502), congratulated the Iranian people on their victory over Israel and the United States of America:
<!-- truncate --> 

> The Zionist regime has nearly collapsed and was crushed by the strikes of the Islamic Republic. They never imagined or conceived that such blows could be delivered to the regime by the Islamic Republic, yet it has happened. We thank God for assisting our armed forces, who managed to break through their advanced multi-layered defenses and leveled many of their urban and military areas to the ground…

> The Islamic Republic has slapped America in the face

> For anyone to expect Iran to surrender to another country is one of those absurd follies that will certainly become the subject of ridicule among wise and knowledgeable people.

It is crucial to understand here that, in their view, victory is not determined by who suffered greater losses. Indeed, they have suffered more losses, but they perceive themselves as victorious precisely because of these sacrifices. Similarly, the Soviet Union suffered greater losses in World War II than the Third Reich, yet the Soviet Union was the victor.

In their understanding, the very act of celebrating victory serves as self-evident proof of that victory. From their perspective, the defeated would not have the opportunity to celebrate; Israel, for example, does not celebrate.

In 1924, in the decision of the case [R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Sussex_Justices,_ex_parte_McCarthy), Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales [Gordon Hewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hewart,_1st_Viscount_Hewart) formulated one of the most remarkable jurisprudential maxims:

> Not only must Justice be done; it must also be seen to be done

> Недостаточно осуществить правосудие, необходимо, чтобы было показано, что осуществлено правосудие

This principle similarly applies to achieving victory in war, particularly in wars involving adversaries such as those Israel fights:

*it is not enough to defeat the enemy; it must also be seen that the enemy is defeated.*

As I have written since the early days of the war with Gaza, victory over Gaza will only occur when a surviving representative of Hamas signs a document acknowledging Gaza's defeat. Anything short of that is not a victory, but merely a temporary ceasefire.

All the more so with such a formidable adversary as Iran, military actions should not end with a tweet by Trump, with all due respect to him, in the online newspaper "Truth." Military actions can be stopped solely and exclusively after Iran signs a document acknowledging its defeat and detailing its obligations towards the victors. Any other approach is folly on the part of the leadership of the United States and Israel.
