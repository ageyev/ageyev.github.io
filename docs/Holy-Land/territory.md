## Borders and Territory of Israel

### General Remarks on Argumentation in Disputes on This Topic

The current official position, expressed in resolutions of the UN General Assembly, documents of the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Criminal Court (ICC), and even the Supreme Court of Israel, and adhered to by the absolute majority of international lawyers, is that Israel is currently occupying certain "Palestinian territories." These usually include the West Bank of the Jordan River, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.

However, despite the firmly established phrase "Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem" and "Israel, the occupying Power" being used in hundreds of documents, it is very difficult to find a genuinely legal analysis explaining why these territories are occupied and where the borders of Israel actually lie, according to international law.

Overall, it can be stated that the tactic of those arguing that Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip are under occupation is to use the expressions: "occupation," "occupied territories," and "Israel, the occupying Power" as frequently and in as many documents as possible.

Thus, the frequency of repetition creates the impression that this is something long-established, universally recognized, and therefore requiring no justification.

A very characteristic example in this regard is the argument presented by representatives of the Palestinian National Authority to the International Criminal Court in case [ICC-01/18](https://www.icc-cpi.int/palestine) when rendering the decision on whether the "West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Gaza" is the territory of Israel or territory occupied by Israel of the "State of Palestine":

> "The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, are consistently referred to by the international community, including the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council, as the occupied Palestinian territory, leaving no doubt as to who has title to this particular territory"

(See para. 34 of the [ICC decision of February 5, 2021](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/CourtRecords/CR2021_01165.PDF))

This is the legal argument: everyone constantly calls this territory the "occupied Palestinian territory", so there is no doubt to whom this territory belongs.

And the International Criminal Court in The Hague agreed with this argument: on February 5, 2021, the ICC issued a [Decision](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/CourtRecords/CR2021_01165.PDF) that the Court's jurisdiction extends to the territories of Gaza and the West Bank, including "East Jerusalem," "occupied by Israel." On March 3, 2021, the ICC Prosecutor opened an investigation into war crimes committed in these territories, and on November 21, 2024, [issued warrants of arrest](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges) for the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of Israel.

In reality, however, this method of argumentation is not legal. And it is not legal even when used by people in judicial robes.

The legal approach consists of formulating the general legal norms applicable to the situation and drawing conclusions based on established facts. Moreover, a "legal norm" means that this norm operates in analogous situations; that is, if we are talking about borders and occupation, we must first define the rules that apply generally to borders and occupation, not just in relation to Israel, but universally.

## Applicable Norms of International Law

Thus, following a strictly legal approach, we will first formulate the legal norms and principles and then draw conclusions from them.

As can be seen, this approach is fundamentally opposite to the one currently adopted.

And these principles, despite their seeming simplicity and obviousness, lead to conclusions that are contrary to both the position of the majority of UN documents and the position of the Supreme Court of Israel.

These principles are as follows:

(1) The territory of a state is the territory within the borders of that state.

(2) A border treaty between neighboring (contiguous) states establishes the border line between them.

(3) Occupation can only be considered the seizure by the armed forces of a state of territory that is *outside* the borders of that state.

(4) The desire, even a very strong one, even an unbearable one, to create one's state on the territory of another state, is not in itself a basis for considering this territory occupied, and does not change existing state borders.

Each of these principles, in our opinion, should be considered a norm of international law, in the sense of [Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_of_international_law), and, as our experience in professional discussions on this topic shows, even those lawyers who are ardent opponents of Israel cannot deny the correctness of any of these four principles.

The application of these principles to the question of where Israel's borders lie—considering the current international treaties—leads to the conclusion that both the Gaza Strip and what is commonly referred to in UN documents as the "West Bank of the Jordan River, including East Jerusalem," are undoubtedly the **territory of Israel**, not "occupied," nor even a ["disputed territory"](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F) ("disputed territory")([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial\_dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_dispute)).

Let us examine this issue in more detail and answer the question: where exactly do Israel's borders lie, and what is Israel actually occupying?

## History

### League of Nations Mandate for Palestine

Since 1922, the territory of Palestine (including the territory of present-day Jordan) was administered by Great Britain, in accordance with the [Mandate](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Palestine_Mandate_\(1922\)) of the League of Nations.

The text of the Mandate itself indicated that all this territory, including the one where Jordan is now located, was originally transferred to such administration *"in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people"*.

Then, on September 16, 1922, the [Trans-Jordan memorandum](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC) was adopted, excluding the territory of present-day Jordan from the territories designated for Jewish settlements. And on May 25, 1946, the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan, created in this territory, gained independence.

### UN Partition Plan for Palestine and the so-called "1947 Borders"

On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution No. 181 ["Future government of Palestine"](https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%90%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B8_%D0%9E%D0%9E%D0%9D_%E2%84%96_A/RES/181_\(II\)).

This resolution recommended the creation of two independent states—a Jewish state and another Arab state (in addition to already independent Jordan)—in the territory of Mandatory Palestine, which was still under British administration.

In discussions about current events, it is sometimes heard that the State of Israel is allegedly an occupier because it occupies territory that was intended by the resolution for the creation of an Arab state.

For example, the corresponding Wikipedia article [Arab–Israeli War (1947–1949)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0_\(1947%E2%80%941949\)#%D0%98%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D1%8B), citing the UN document [Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem](https://www.un.org/unispal/ru/origins-and-evolution-of-the-palestine-problem/part-i-1917-1947/), states:

> As a result of the war, about half of the territories allocated for an Arab state and West Jerusalem were occupied by Israel.

Also, for example, the President of France recently [stated](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20241015-in-clash-with-netanyahu-macron-says-israel-pm-mustn-t-forget-his-country-created-by-un-decision): "Mr Netanyahu mustn't forget that his country was created by a decision of the UN".

However, this is a legally erroneous position. And due to its common acceptance, the legal significance of Resolution 181 must be examined in detail.

The Arab side officially rejected this resolution at the time with a joint [statement](http://www.mideastweb.org/arableague1948.htm) by the League of Arab States on May 15, 1948 (i.e., the day after the proclamation of Israel's independence), and started a war against Israel, in which Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Yemen directly participated.

But let's imagine the situation: on the evening of May 15, 1948, the Declaration of Independence of Israel was proclaimed, and the League of Arab States, instead of issuing a statement rejecting UN GA Resolution No. 181 and military aggression, issues a statement that the LAS, as the representative of the Arab people, warmly supports the plan outlined in Resolution 181 and confirms the Arab side's consent to its implementation.

Question: What, from a legal point of view, are the borders of Israel at this moment (May 15, 1948) under such conditions?

The legally correct answer is:

Based on the text of Resolution 181, it did not in itself change the provisions of the Mandate, did not establish borders, and did not obligate anyone to anything. It merely recommended a plan for the partition of the territory and “requests that ... the Security Council take the necessary measures as provided for in the plan for its implementation”.

That is, in the absence of any Security Council decisions, it had no legal consequences, even with the approval of the proposed plan by the Arab and Israeli sides.

This did not deprive the parties of the possibility of concluding treaties on new borders in the future in accordance with the recommendations of the resolution, but at the moment the Mandate ended, since its provisions were recognized as mandatory (**which Resolution 181 itself confirmed**) and since no changes were made to it, the entire territory west of the Jordan River and up to the Mediterranean Sea, including the city of Jerusalem, became the territory of the Jewish state (i.e., Israel) based on the provisions of the Mandate itself, taking into account the provisions of Art. 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

That is, from the point of view of international law, the borders of the State of Israel from May 14, 1948, were determined by the borders of the territory that the Mandate allocated for the Jewish state. And it remained so until Israel concluded border treaties with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994, which, however, established the border along the same former Mandate borders (which we will examine in more detail later).

From which it follows:

1)  The borders of the territory of Israel from May 14, 1948, were legally determined by the borders of the Mandate, the provisions of which were not changed by anyone.

2)  The territory of Israel from 1949 (until 1967) was under the illegal occupation of Jordan (West Bank and Jerusalem, illegally annexed by Jordan in 1950) and Egypt (Gaza Strip).

### The "Green Line" of 1949 (or "pre-1967 borders")

In 1949, under the auspices of the UN, negotiations took place between Israel and all aggressor states, except Iraq, which resulted in armistice agreements on the ceasefire lines ([1949 Armistice Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements)).

The line separating the troops after the armistice agreement was called the [Green Line](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%91%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_\(%D0%98%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C\)).

This line is also sometimes called the "pre-1967 borders" or "1967 borders".

For example, the [UN GA Resolution of 2019-12-13](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3846447) speaks of "preserving the principle of the coexistence of two states within the borders existing before 1967".

However, the armistice agreements themselves explicitly stated that:

> Demarcation Line is not to be construed in any sense as a political or territorial boundary.

That is, in reality, no "1967 borders" ever existed; there was a demarcation line established by the armistice agreements, which, on the contrary, emphasized that it was not a border, but merely a line for troop withdrawal.

### The Six-Day War of 1967

During the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank of the Jordan River, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.

The Sinai Peninsula was subsequently returned to Egypt under the 1979 treaty.

The remaining territories recaptured by Israel in 1967, as seen from the above, should be considered territories legally belonging to Israel since May 14, 1948, and liberated by Israel from the occupation of hostile armies.

#### Legal difference between the territories conquered in 1948-49 and 1967

Despite the common view, there is absolutely no legal difference between the territories of former Mandatory Palestine (here we are not talking about the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights), control over which was established by Israel in 1967 and in 1949.

In both cases, control over the former territory of Mandatory Palestine, originally intended for the creation of a Jewish state, was obtained by Israel in the course of war.

## Modern Borders and Territory of Israel

### What are the borders of a state and the territory of a state

[State border](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0) is a line and the vertical surface (conditional) passing through this line, defining the limits of the state territory (land, waters, subsoil, and airspace) of a particular state, i.e., the spatial limit of the operation of state sovereignty.

*The territory of the state is the territory within its borders*.

As a general rule, borders are established by border treaties between neighboring (contiguous) states.

Contrary to popular belief, borders are not registered with the UN or any other international body.

### The Gaza Strip and the border between Israel and Egypt

According to Art. II of the [Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty of 1979](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201136/volume-1136-i-17813-english.pdf):

> The permanent boundary between Egypt and Israel is the recognized international boundary between Egypt and the former mandated territory of Palestine, as shown on the map at Annex II, 1 **without prejudice to the issue of the status of the Gaza Strip**. The Parties recognize this boundary as inviolable. Each will respect the territorial integrity of the other, including their territorial waters and airspace.

Here, the main question is the interpretation of the phrase "*without prejudice to the issue of the status of the Gaza Strip*". Opinions are encountered that this phrase itself defines the existence of some status. But in fact, quite the opposite, it means that the status at the time the treaty was concluded is not defined or affected by this treaty.

That is, if the treaty states that the parties have agreed that a fence will be built between them, but "without prejudice to the issue of the color" ("without prejudice to the issue of the color"), this in no way means that the parties have agreed that the fence is green; on the contrary, the parties emphasized that the treaty contains no conditions about the possible color of the fence.

Why was the Gaza Strip mentioned separately? Because there was an additional agreement to the treaty "concerning the establishment of full autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip" (Letter Agreement 1 Additional to The Treaty of Peace of 26 March 19792 Between Egypt and Israel, concerning the establishment of full autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip), in which the parties agreed to start negotiations on the modalities for establishing the elected self-governing authority (administrative council). It should be emphasized here that the parties agreed only to **begin negotiations** on the possible creation of self-governing bodies, not on their creation, and that the subject of negotiations was defined as granting autonomy with the creation of self-governing bodies, but by no means the deprivation of Israel of its territory or the creation of any other sovereign state on it.

Thus, from the moment this treaty entered into force, the border between Egypt and Israel runs where the border between Egypt and Mandatory Palestine ran; accordingly, on one side of the border is the territory of Egypt, and on the other is the territory of Israel.

That is, the treaty actually drew the border where it legally ran before that. But from the moment the treaty entered into force, the basis for determining the borderline became the provisions of this treaty, and not the norms of the Mandate, as it was before.

The Gaza Strip, which was previously under the de facto control of Egypt, is thus currently on the Israeli side of the border, meaning *on the territory of Israel*.

The treaty specifically indicates that Israel has no obligations to Egypt regarding the status of the Gaza Strip arising from this treaty, except for the obligation to participate in negotiations on the possible creation of self-governing bodies.

### Judea and Samaria District ("West Bank of the Jordan River") and Jerusalem, the border between Israel and Jordan

According to the [Treaty of Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan of October 26, 1994](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/il20jo941026peacetreatyisraeljordan.pdf), the riverbeds of the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers (a tributary of the Jordan) were established as the approved border between Israel and Jordan, and it was agreed that if the riverbed changes naturally, the border will follow the new riverbed.

A map is attached to the treaty on which the border between Israel and Jordan is marked. The map itself states regarding the borderline:

> "This line is the administrative boundary between Jordan and the territory which came under Israeli Military government control in 1967. Any treatment of this line shall be **without prejudice to the status of that territory**".

Here again, in discussions with anti-Israel opponents, the opinion is encountered that the phrase "without prejudice to the status of that territory" means conferring some special status on this territory, which means that although this territory is on the Israeli side of the border, it is not the territory of Israel.

However:

1)  Such an opinion contradicts the very concept of a "state border" as a line separating the territories of adjacent states.

2)  As indicated above regarding the current treaty between Israel and Egypt of 1979 and the example of the hypothetical agreement on the color of the fence, the phrase "without prejudice to the status" itself does not establish any definite status.

Thus, according to the treaty between Israel and Jordan of 1994, the territory east of the Jordan River is the territory of Jordan, and the territory west of it is the territory of Israel.

### The Oslo Accords

On September 28, 1995, the ["Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip"](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/il20ps950928interimagreementwestbankgazastrip28osloii29.pdf)), informally known as "Oslo II Accord," was signed in Washington.

This agreement **did not provide for changes to the border between Israel and Jordan established by the aforementioned treaty between them**.

That this agreement does not affect existing borders is directly indicated in Art. XXXI(5) of the Agreement, which stated that the issue of borders is a matter for future negotiations, not this agreement:

> "Permanent status negotiations will commence as soon as possible, but not later than May 4, 1996, between the Parties. It is understood that these negotiations shall cover remaining issues, including: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements, **borders**, relations and cooperation with other neighbors, and other issues of common interest".

Thus, this Agreement did not change the borders of Israel's territory. Consequently, it provided for the creation of a self-governing entity *on the territory of Israel*.

This Agreement did not provide for the creation of a sovereign state for the Arabs living in this territory, nor did it provide for the extension of its sovereignty to part of Israel's territory, and it directly prohibited such actions unilaterally, see Art. XXXI(7) of the Agreement:

> "Neither side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations".

Accordingly, the actions of the leadership of the Palestinian National Authority, representing attempts to call themselves a "state" ("State of Palestine") without Israel's consent or to act as an independent state, are a direct and explicit violation of the Oslo Accords, and, consequently, from the point of view of these agreements, are legally null and void.

Thus, currently, the border between Israel and Jordan still runs along the Jordan River, and the PNA functions on the territory of Israel in accordance with the Oslo II Agreement, despite the fact that this Agreement has been violated by the PNA on a number of points, and Israel has every reason to declare it no longer valid.

## The Concept of "Annexation" in International Law

[Annexation](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F) in international law is by definition the *unilateral* incorporation of the territory of another state. That is, the incorporation of the territory of another state without its consent.

Since the establishment of the border between Israel and Jordan and with Egypt was carried out by concluding treaties with these countries, Israel cannot *annex* territories that belong to Israel under these treaties.

### The Golan Heights

Israel annexed the Golan Heights because it incorporated them (see [Golan Heights Law](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD_%D0%BE_%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%85)) without the consent of Syria, to which they previously belonged.

Only a separation of forces agreement was signed with Syria ([Separation of Forces Agreement Between Israel and Syria; May 31, 1974](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/pal04.asp)), but the parties remain in a state of war, as the agreement itself stipulated that it is not a peace agreement ("This agreement is not a peace agreement").

In this regard, [UN Security Council Resolution No. 497 of December 17, 1981](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8_%D0%9E%D0%9E%D0%9D_497) should also be mentioned.

On the one hand, the assertion contained in this resolution that "the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible under the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of international law and relevant Security Council resolutions" is **incorrect**. The acquisition of territory through aggression is inadmissible.

However, the forceful taking of territories from an aggressor is permissible from the point of view of international law (just as Germany and Japan lost their territories after World War II).

And in this case, Syria was the aggressor. *And, accordingly, the annexation of the aggressor's territory is lawful*.

On the other hand, despite the fact that this resolution contains a clear legal error, by virtue of [Art. 25 of the UN Charter](https://www.un.org/ru/about-us/un-charter/chapter-5), until it is repealed, UN members, including Israel, are obligated to comply with its requirements.

That is, Israel must indeed repeal the annexation and consider them occupied, not annexed.

## Positions of Various Authorities on the Issue

### UN

As already stated, the UN uses the phrase "Israel, the occupying Power" and "Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem" in numerous documents.

Particular note should also be made of the [Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, July 13, 2004](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/advisory-opinions/advisory-opinions-2004-ru.pdf).

Paragraph 78 of the Advisory Opinion states that the signing of the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan did not change the fact that this territory is occupied by Israel.

Legally, this is, of course, complete absurdity, and is equivalent to the assertion that "absolutely nothing can change the fact that this territory is occupied" or "never and under no circumstances, and despite any treaties, can it be recognized that this territory belongs to Israel".

Alas, it must be stated that the Advisory Opinions of the UN International Court of Justice (which, incidentally, are not binding) can be erroneous.

### Supreme Court of Israel

The Israeli Supreme Court has never considered the question of whether the borders drawn in the treaties between Israel and Jordan and with Egypt establish the borders of Israel with Jordan and Egypt.

As stated in the publication by Professor [David Kretzmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kretzmer) "The law of belligerent occupation in the Supreme Court of Israel" ([Kretzmer, David. (2012). The law of belligerent occupation in the Supreme Court of Israel. International Review of the Red Cross](https://international-review.icrc.org/sites/default/files/irrc-885-kretzmer.pdf)):

> The factual recognition by Israeli authorities that the applicable law in the occupied territories is the law governing belligerent occupation spared the Israeli Supreme Court from having to decide what elements make up an occupation. While the Court referred to the issue during the Israeli presence in Lebanon in 1982, it later also addressed the question of whether Israel continues to be the occupying power in Gaza following the withdrawal of its forces and settlements from there.

That is, the Israeli Supreme Court has never proceeded from the premise that the borders of Israel's territory are delimited by its treaties with Egypt and Jordan.

Thus, in the [judgment in the case of Mara’abe v. The Prime Minister of Israel](https://www.refworld.org/jurisprudence/caselaw/isrsc/2005/en/39035) of September 15, 2005, the Supreme Court of Israel, presided over by [Aharon Barak](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA,_%D0%90%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD), wrote:

> "The Judea and Samaria areas are held by the State of Israel in belligerent occupation. The representative of the State in the area is the military commander. He is not the sovereign in the territory occupied by the belligerent occupation (see Beit Sourik case, p. 832). His authority is granted to him by public international law concerning belligerent occupation. The legal meaning of this view is twofold: first, Israeli law does not apply in these areas. They were not ‘annexed’ by Israel. Second, the legal regime that applies in these areas is determined by public international law concerning belligerent occupation (see International Court of Justice, 1661/05 Gaza Coast Regional Council v. Knesset et al.). Central to this public international law are the “Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land” established by the Hague Convention of October 18, 1907 (hereinafter — the Hague Regulations). These rules are a reflection of customary international law. The law of belligerent occupation is also set forth in the IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949 (hereinafter — the Fourth Geneva Convention)".

This reasoning gives a lawyer the impression not of a legal conclusion but of a propaganda document: the mention of international conventions alongside the conclusion about the occupied status of the specified territories is clearly intended to create the illusion that the thesis of occupation is justified by the norms of international conventions.

Although, in reality, the court should have first decided whether this territory at the time of the case's consideration was the territory of Israel or the territory of some other state, and if it was the territory of some other state, then decide whether Israel occupies it. If it occupies it, then establish whether both the occupying and occupied states are parties to the relevant conventions, when they acceded to them, and whether any reservations were made upon accession to the convention.

Article 2 of the Hague Convention, which establishes the "Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land," states that the norms of the Convention are binding only on the Contracting Powers and only if all belligerents participate in the convention.

Israel has not ratified this Hague Convention to date, and the Palestinian National Authority only made a statement of accession to the convention in 2014 (see the [list of participants in this convention](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/hague-conv-iv-1907/state-parties)). But the court, having mentioned this convention in the decision, somehow "modestly" omitted mentioning this.

So, the court did not make the caveat "These rules are a reflection of customary international law" in vain. It can be assumed that the judges understood that the Hague Convention, according to its Article 2, was not directly applicable to the situation under consideration, even if an occupation had occurred.

For some reason, the court wanted to promote the thesis that Gaza and the West Bank are occupied and pretend that this thesis is based on norms of international law.

The **Report on the Legal Status of Building in Judea and Samaria** (https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072813/http://regavim.org.il/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/The-Levy-Commission-Report-on-the-Legal-Status-of-Building-in-Judea-and-Samaria2.pdf), also known as the **[Levy Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levy_Report)**, was prepared at the request of the Prime Minister of Israel ([Benjamin Netanyahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu)) and the Minister of Justice ([Yaakov Neeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Neeman)) and published in 2012 by a commission chaired by former Israeli Supreme Court Justice [Edmond Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Levy_\(judge\)).

The report contained a section titled "The Status of the Territories of Judea and Samaria under International Law." The commission concluded that the specified territories should not be considered occupied for two reasons:

(1)

> "The most reasonable interpretation of those provisions of international law seems to be that the commonly accepted term “occupant” with its obligations is intended to be applied in the case of short-term periods of occupation of the territory of a sovereign state, pending the conclusion of the conflict between the parties and the return of the territory or other agreed settlement. However, Israel’s presence in Judea and Samaria is fundamentally different: its control over the territory has lasted for decades, and no one can foresee when or if it will end at all".

(2)

> "The territory was seized from a state (the Kingdom of Jordan) whose sovereignty over that territory was never legally and finally confirmed, and which has since relinquished its claim to sovereignty; the State of Israel has a claim to sovereign rights over this territory".

In our opinion, the Levy Commission's first argument is insufficiently substantiated. In international law, there are no definite time limits after which an occupation ceases to be considered an occupation, just as the occupying party's intention to cease the occupation or the absence thereof is not a criterion for recognizing or not recognizing the territory as occupied.

As for the second argument, it should be emphasized that:

a) It is correct to say, not that Jordan's sovereignty "over that territory was never legally and finally confirmed," but that from May 14, 1948, it was the territory of Israel (according to the Mandate provisions), illegally occupied/annexed by Jordan.

b) At this point, it is no longer important whether Jordan had rights to these territories before the conclusion of the border treaty between Israel and Jordan; the only important thing is that by concluding this treaty, it recognized these territories as being on the Israeli side of the state border.

## Conclusions

(1) As is evident from the above, in reality, both the Gaza Strip, the Judea and Samaria District (West Bank of the Jordan River), and Jerusalem are part of the territory of Israel under international law, as they are within its legally established borders, defined by the treaties currently in force with the neighboring states (Egypt and Jordan, respectively).

(2) Thus, they cannot be considered occupied in any way. And legally, their annexation is impossible, as one cannot annex one's own territory.

(3) The current documents defining the borders of Israel with Egypt and Jordan are its treaties with Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994). This method of establishing borders (treaties with bordering states) is accepted in international law. Thus, from an international legal point of view, Israel does not require any decisions or the signing of any other documents to establish its borders. And, just like all other states in the world, the sovereign territory of Israel is the territory within its borders.
