Gaza would declare victory, receiving fresh streams of financial and humanitarian aid, increased because now it needed \\"rebuilding.\\" Those allocating and channeling the aid would benefit from greater kickbacks. Gaza would stockpile new rockets, and the cycle would repeat.\\n\\nWhy did our military believe Gaza would not initiate a full-scale war? \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e \\n\\nBecause militarily, Gaza cannot stand against Israel\u2014the imbalance of power is too great. The Hamas leadership understood this very well and could not fail to comprehend the situation.\\n\\nSo what did our military overlook, and what was Hamas counting on? They overlooked Hamas\u2019s political support\u2014not just from corrupt officials eager for fresh financial inflows to Gaza, but also from broad segments of left-wing circles in Israel and internationally.\\n\\nHamas clearly anticipated executing a swift and effective raid on border military facilities, demonstrating their efficiency to sponsors, showing that with continued funding and armament, they could build forces capable of confronting Israel. They expected Israel\u2019s retaliatory strike to be curtailed by the usual methods: photographs and videos of dead children, weeping women, and outcries from the global and domestic left\u2014\\"this must stop immediately, regardless of who started it; don\'t you have a sympathy for innocent children?\\"\\n\\nBut, \\n\\na) the attack proved far too effective, catching Israeli forces severely off-guard, and \\n\\nB) most crucially, Gaza residents storming through the breached wall into Israeli settlements and a music festival committed unimaginable atrocities. They proudly posted videos on Telegram, which quickly spread to other social networks and media, thus breaking the traditional pattern of anti-Israeli propaganda.\\n\\n\\nIn other words, if we assume Israel wages war as wars have traditionally been waged, as against Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan, \u2014 Gaza stands no chance. But Hamas attacked, betting Israel would not fight through to the end.\\n\\nCurrently, the only chance Hamas has to avoid destruction is a ceasefire \u2014 pushed by Israeli leftists (\\"deal now at any price\\") and other Hamas allies, including many U.S. and European officials benefiting from kickbacks tied to Gaza\u2019s financial and humanitarian aid.\\n\\nI\'ve previously written about the conflict between \\"bunnies\\" and \\"lions\\" within Israeli society. Indeed, it must be understood that the \\"bunnies\\" bear responsibility for the October 7, 2023, attack. Had Hamas relied solely on military strength without counting on political protection, it would not have carried out the invasion. Hamas clearly depended on international pressure and internal Israeli leftist influence as its main tools for neutralizing Israeli retaliation.\\n\\nThis frightening realization for leftists is underscored by the document [published in Bild](https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/bild-exklusiv-zum-schaudern-das-plant-der-hamas-chef-mit-den-geiseln-66d98503c0fd674dd9f5d092), revealing Hamas\u2019s reliance on the Israeli left in its war against Israel\u2014a publication that led to [Eli Feldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Feldstein)\u2019s arrest. Ironically, the disclosure of this document harmed Hamas\'s political plans rather than the Israeli government\u2019s, raising the rhetorical question: whose secret plans were those arresting Feldstein actually protecting?\\n\\n--- \\n\\n[Discussion on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid0kZo6yBFCYmVJHoh8Z3KzBZLg8a5KamiQAh65o1gFGPC32yTzzCHjTg9A2stxfoqGl) (in Russian)\\n\\n---"},{"id":"from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-06-from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates/index.md","title":"From the Nile to the Euphrates","description":"From the Nile to the Euphrates: On the Question of Israel\u2019s Biblical Borders","date":"2025-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Viktor Ageyev","permalink":"/blog/tags/ageyev","description":"Viktor Ageyev"},{"inline":false,"label":"Holy Land","permalink":"/blog/tags/holy-land","description":"Holy Land"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Ageyev","title":"author","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/ageyev"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/ageyev","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ageyev/","github":"https://github.com/ageyev"},"imageURL":"/img/authors/ageyev_viktor_02.jpg","key":"ageyev"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates","title":"From the Nile to the Euphrates","authors":["ageyev"],"tags":["ageyev","holy-land"],"draft":false,"description":"From the Nile to the Euphrates: On the Question of Israel\u2019s Biblical Borders","image":"/img/Illustrations/blog/2025-02-06-from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates/Bereshit_15-18.png"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1745341953000,"lastUpdatedBy":"ageyev","prevItem":{"title":"What Could Gaza/Hamas Have Counted on When Launching this War?","permalink":"/blog/what_gaza_was_counting_on"},"nextItem":{"title":"October 7","permalink":"/blog/october7"}},"content":"![\\"From the Nile to the Euphrates\\"](/img/Illustrations/blog/2025-02-06-from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates/Bereshit_15-18.png)\\n\\nOne of the debated issues when discussing Israel\u2019s borders from a legal perspective (in our view, sacred texts should also be considered in international law) is the well-known phrase *\\"from the Nile to the Euphrates,\\"* understood as the Tanakhic (biblical) definition of Israel\u2019s borders.\\n\\nAccordingly, on the one hand, some Israelis believe that Israel\u2019s borders should be expanded to the \\"Torah-defined\\" boundaries from the Nile to the Euphrates. On the other hand, Israel\u2019s opponents accuse it of striving to seize the corresponding territories.\\n\\nHowever, this interpretation does not align with the biblical text. This passage is truly remarkable, considering the time it was written. That is, it was written thousands of years ago, and today it has come to pass as foretold. \\n\\nNo, Israel\'s borders do not extend from the Nile to the Euphrates, nor should they.

Thus your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin close by the side of Edom, and your south border shall begin at the end of the Salt Sea eastward; and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon; and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the Brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Sea. And for the western border, ye shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your west border. And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea ye shall mark out your line unto mount Hor; from mount Hor ye shall mark out a line unto the entrance to Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad; and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your north border. And ye shall mark out your line for the east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham; and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall strike upon the slope of the sea of Chinnereth eastward; and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea; this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.\\n\\nWhich roughly corresponds to the current borders of Israel: on the western side is the Mediterranean Sea (\\"the Great Sea\\"), on the eastern side is the Jordan, the Sea of Galilee (Chinnereth) and the Dead (Salt) Sea, on the south are the deserts of the Sinai or Arabian Peninsula (\\"the desert of Sin\\"), and on the north is the southern part of present-day Syria.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n## References: \\n\\n[Wikipedia: Greater Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Israel)\\n\\n---\\n\\nthis post in: \\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid0GqkDefYN7YKmHdi1tzLC7Ai1vcoRvH2CqdSvhZS2yfhKfMM3SA1rf9yGWHm8yivTl) (discussion in Russian) \\n\\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ageyev_from-the-nile-to-the-euphrates-on-the-activity-7293287687610912770-pYEd/) \\n\\n[Twitter](https://x.com/ageyev/status/1887506345617768538) \\n\\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvBBNkoYaM/) \\n\\n--- \\n\\nSee also: \\n\\n[Where Are Israel\'s Borders and What Is Israel Actually Occupying]( /Holy-Land/borders_and_territory_of_israel)"},{"id":"october7","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/october7","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-07-october-7/index.md","title":"October 7","description":"IDF Soldier\'s Memories of October 7, 2023","date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Viktor Ageyev","permalink":"/blog/tags/ageyev","description":"Viktor Ageyev"},{"inline":false,"label":"Holy Land","permalink":"/blog/tags/holy-land","description":"Holy Land"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Ageyev","title":"author","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/ageyev"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/ageyev","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ageyev/","github":"https://github.com/ageyev"},"imageURL":"/img/authors/ageyev_viktor_02.jpg","key":"ageyev"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"october7","title":"October 7","authors":["ageyev"],"tags":["ageyev","holy-land"],"draft":false,"date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","description":"IDF Soldier\'s Memories of October 7, 2023","lang":"en","image":"/img/Illustrations/blog/2024-10-07-october-7/2024-08-18.Mark_with_rifle.jpeg"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1745340823000,"lastUpdatedBy":"ageyev","prevItem":{"title":"From the Nile to the Euphrates","permalink":"/blog/from_the_Nile_to_the_Euphrates"},"nextItem":{"title":"Lions and Bunnies","permalink":"/blog/lions_and_bunnies"}},"content":"This is the text of my eldest son, written a week after October 7th.

My story that I went through, and with great luck, I am now able to write these words.\\n\\n**October 7th**, a day we woke up to the announcement of a \\"Red Alert\\" throughout the entire sector. We were in the shelter, and no one paid too much attention to these missiles, because what can they really do besides a few rockets...\\n\\nWe heard gunfire from the direction of a nearby base, and within a few minutes, our gear was on us, and we headed in that direction. From that moment, we entered the war. It\'s impossible to describe the feelings you go through during this. You stop thinking and feeling; you just do what you need to do. You strive, advance, and shoot\u2014all in a combat zone unfamiliar to you, all while rockets whistle overhead.\\n\\nAnd then comes the moment when I get hit by the bullet. At that moment, I felt nothing; I looked at my leg and couldn\'t believe this was happening. From here, everything happened in seconds. Seconds in which they take you back, apply a tourniquet, and tell you that everything will be okay. It all happened in seconds\u2014seconds that replay themselves in my head for entire days.\\n\\nI can\'t describe my pride toward my friends from Unit 414 who fought and destroyed the enemy in that battle. I love you, and you will always remain in my heart as the bravest people I\'ve ever known, each and every one of you. You are my heroes and heroines, and I\'m proud to have fought alongside you.\\n\\nI have never felt more pain than the pain over those who fell. I still can\'t grasp the number of people who were taken from this world\u2014and all in one day. Everyone I know lost someone: a friend, a family member, a brother, or a sister. Each one of them is etched on the heart of each of us forever.

The imagery they associate with themselves includes predatory animals\u2014most often lions in Israel, due to local historical tradition ([Lion of Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_of_Judah)).\\n\\nThis metaphor helps explain what seemed like a [shocking incident](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=812790770995978) in June 2024, in Caesarea, when leftists tore down and trampled on portraits of fallen soldiers and replaced them with images of hostages.\\n\\nTo them, the \\"lions\\" are alien heroes \u2014 associated with violence and cruelty. Their heroes are the \\"bunnies\\" \u2014 the victims. In fact, the cult of the victim is a core part of leftist ideology.\\n\\nAccordingly, the strategies for handling conflict \u2014 and the values themselves \u2014 are completely different for \\"bunnies\\" and \\"lions.\\"\\n\\n\\"Bunnies\\" say: \u201cThese hyenas are evil and dangerous. If we fight them, they will tear us apart. We should step aside and try not to provoke them. And if they\u2019ve taken some of our baby bunnies, we should try to appease the hyenas so they let them go and show that we\u2019re gentle and harmless and not a threat to them.\u201d\\n\\n\\"Lions\\" say: \u201cWe should rip the heads off the nearby hyenas and show those severed heads to the faraway hyenas \u2014 so they\u2019ll fear us.\u201d\\n\\nNaturally, the \\"bunnies\\" see this lion-like strategy as suicidal and view the \\"lions\\" as a threat to Israel\u2019s very survival.\\n\\n## (2) Worldview\\n\\nClosely related to the first point, but separate: the left generally holds a materialistic worldview.\\n\\nThey believe that religion cannot and should not play any meaningful role in the modern world. In their eyes, religion is nothing more than an outdated and irrational superstition.\\n\\nIncidentally, this is why the [Haredim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism) (ultra-Orthodox Jews) end up in the right-wing camp, even though ideologically they are actually leftist\u2014and this distorts their religion. Their so-called \u201cfaith,\u201d instead of making them fearless (\u201clions\u201d), is used to instill fear, turning them into not just \u201cbunnies,\u201d but bunnies constantly trembling with fear of the outside world.\\n\\nAnd while ordinary secular leftists, though inclined to appeasement, are still capable of fighting (like our leftist generals, some of whom serve in right-wing governments), most of these Haredim are not capable of fighting at all. But that is a side note\u2014albeit an important one in this context.\\n\\nBecause of this attitude toward religion, when the left tries to understand our enemies\u2019 motivations, [they are fundamentally unable to do so](/blog/understand-the-enemy). They believe our enemies fight us because we \\"oppress\\" and \\"occupy\\" them. And what other reason could there be? So, if we stop oppressing them and withdraw, give them land\u2014they will no longer have a reason to attack us.\\n\\nTo the left, this line of reasoning seems logical and rational. And because it aligns perfectly with the deep-rooted psychological conflict-avoidance strategy of the \\"bunnies,\\" they find it incomprehensible how the right can be so stupid as not to see this.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[Post and discussion on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid023kZNSLYpp9vNbMvw63wSWD82NLuDZKwJrynyt9FjUCZovveRbpY8ft7wosptydDNl) (in Russian)\\n\\n---"},{"id":"understand-the-enemy","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/understand-the-enemy","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-24-understand_the_enemy/index.md","title":"Understanding the Enemy","description":"The Israeli left cannot bring Israel to peace because, fundamentally, they are incapable of understanding those who wage war against us","date":"2024-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Holy Land","permalink":"/blog/tags/holy-land","description":"Holy Land"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Viktor Ageyev","title":"author","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/ageyev"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/ageyev","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ageyev/","github":"https://github.com/ageyev"},"imageURL":"/img/authors/ageyev_viktor_02.jpg","key":"ageyev"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"understand-the-enemy","title":"Understanding the Enemy","authors":["ageyev"],"tags":["holy-land"],"draft":false,"date":"2024-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The Israeli left cannot bring Israel to peace because, fundamentally, they are incapable of understanding those who wage war against us","lang":"en"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1745360894000,"lastUpdatedBy":"ageyev","prevItem":{"title":"Lions and Bunnies","permalink":"/blog/lions_and_bunnies"}},"content":"The Israeli left cannot bring Israel to peace because, fundamentally, they are incapable of understanding those who wage war against us.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nCurrently, the main agenda of the left in domestic politics is the struggle against religion in favor of a secular state (which is why the Haredi parties, who are in essence also left-wing, are not aligned with them).\\n\\nBut on the other side, this is a religious war for the Holy Land. They want to destroy Israel because Israeli rule over the Holy City (Al-Quds) and the Temple (Al-Aqsa Mosque) is seen by them as an insult to their religion.\\n\\nAtheist leftists are fundamentally incapable of believing this. In their view, the war is being waged against us because we oppress them, because we occupy them, because they are exercising their right to self-determination, and so on. And if these \u201ccauses\u201d are removed, the war will end.\\n\\nAll leftist ideas about achieving peace are based on this: let\u2019s recognize their right to self-determination, let\u2019s give them autonomy, let\u2019s leave them alone\u2014then they will live with us in peace.\\n\\nThey won\u2019t. The Arabs have no lack of territory\u2014they control over 13 million square kilometers. Plus or minus 22,000 kilometers is meaningless\u2014it\u2019s about 0.17% of the Arab world. Nor is there a problem with having an Arab state\u2014there are nearly twenty of them, including one in Palestine (Jordan).\\n\\nThe problem is that Islam is, originally, the religion of *Banu Isra\u2019il*, i.e., the Israelites.\\n\\nBut Muslims believe that God abandoned and cursed the Israelites, and that they, the Muslims, have taken their place as the true followers of the religion of Musa (Moses), Dawud (David), and Sulayman (Solomon).\\n\\nHow do they know this? Because God expelled the Jews from the Holy Land and handed it over to the Muslims. And for centuries, Muslims knew they were the bearers of the true faith, while the Jews were cursed.\\n\\nBut now the Israelites have regained control over the Holy Land and the Holy City. And what does that imply? That everything once associated with the Jews now applies to the Muslims? That God has now abandoned the Muslims as He once abandoned the Jews?\\n\\nThis thought is unbearable for a devout Muslim, and he will do everything to reclaim the Holy Land. \u201cEverything\u201d includes war, bribery, propaganda, lies, and atrocities. Many of them are ready to fight and die for it.\\n\\nThey don\u2019t want territory or autonomy\u2014they want to know that God has not forsaken them and certainly has not exchanged them for those despicable Jews, whom they\u2019ve looked down on for centuries. They want to be with God. They want to be part of the ancient true religion. And for them, Al-Aqsa symbolizes that connection. And they will not trade that for money, or for security, or for land. But these are concepts that, in the worldview of the left, either don\u2019t exist at all or are not taken seriously.\\n\\nAnd without understanding the true causes of the conflict, of course, there can be no solution.\\n\\nIt was foolish to think that by leaving Gaza, we would gain peace. They don\u2019t care about Gaza. They are ready to sacrifice Gaza along with all its inhabitants\u2014as the Hamas leadership openly states (when speaking in Arabic). What they want is Al-Quds and Al-Aqsa. Which, again, they openly say, you just have to listen. \\n\\n---\\n\\n[Post and discussion on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid02tPEi5cCnuSr67La9TrwjWdVcANYvZKx7udY5jGRYWgnRUaeZsToBBMAPnQiGL8bil) (in Russian)\\n\\n---"}]}}')}}]);
