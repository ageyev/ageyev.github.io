            "content_html": "<p>One of the debated issues when discussing Israel’s borders from a legal perspective (in our view, sacred texts should also be considered in international law) is the well-known phrase <em>\"from the Nile to the Euphrates,\"</em> understood as the Tanakhic (biblical) definition of Israel’s borders.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, on one hand, some Israelis believe that Israel’s borders should be expanded to the \"Torah-defined\" boundaries from the Nile to the Euphrates. On the other hand, Israel’s opponents accuse it of striving to seize the corresponding territories.</p>\n<p>However, this interpretation does not align with the biblical text. This passage is truly remarkable, considering the time it was written. That is, it was written thousands of years ago, and today it has come to pass as foretold.</p>\n<p>No, Israel's borders do not extend from the Nile to the Euphrates, nor should they. In reality, this is not about the borders of Israel.</p>\n<p>It was written as follows (Bereshit/Genesis <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15:18</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא, כָּרַת יְהוָה אֶת-אַבְרָם--בְּרִית לֵאמֹר: לְזַרְעֲךָ, נָתַתִּי אֶת-הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת, מִנְּהַר מִצְרַיִם, עַד-הַנָּהָר הַגָּדֹל נְהַר-פְּרָת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(On that day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying: \"To your descendants I give these lands, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates\")</p>\n<p>In the King James translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The descendants of Abraham are not only the Jews but also the Arabs.</p>\n<p>Thus, indeed, in the present time, as foretold, the lands from the Nile to the Euphrates are owned by the descendants of Abraham.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"&amp;quot;From the Nile to the Euphrates&amp;quot;\" src=\"https://international-law.info/assets/images/Bereshit_15-18-dee0bc18ba20705fc925fbf69c4ce280.png\" width=\"834\" height=\"104\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>this post in:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DFvBBNkoYaM/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ageyev/status/1887506345617768538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitte</a></p>",

My story that I went through, and with great luck, I am now able to write these words.</p>\n<p><strong>October 7th</strong>, a day we woke up to the announcement of a \"Red Alert\" throughout the entire sector. We were in the shelter, and no one paid too much attention to these missiles, because what can they really do besides a few rockets...</p>\n<p>We heard gunfire from the direction of a nearby base, and within a few minutes, our gear was on us, and we headed in that direction. From that moment, we entered the war. It's impossible to describe the feelings you go through during this. You stop thinking and feeling; you just do what you need to do. You strive, advance, and shoot—all in a combat zone unfamiliar to you, all while rockets whistle overhead.</p>\n<p>And then comes the moment when I get hit by the bullet. At that moment, I felt nothing; I looked at my leg and couldn't believe this was happening. From here, everything happened in seconds. Seconds in which they take you back, apply a tourniquet, and tell you that everything will be okay. It all happened in seconds—seconds that replay themselves in my head for entire days.</p>\n<p>I can't describe my pride toward my friends from Unit 414 who fought and destroyed the enemy in that battle. I love you, and you will always remain in my heart as the bravest people I've ever known, each and every one of you. You are my heroes and heroines, and I'm proud to have fought alongside you.</p>\n<p>I have never felt more pain than the pain over those who fell. I still can't grasp the number of people who were taken from this world—and all in one day. Everyone I know lost someone: a friend, a family member, a brother, or a sister. Each one of them is etched on the heart of each of us forever. No one will be forgotten.</p>\n<p><em>\"Whoever is merciful to the cruel will end up being cruel to the merciful.\"</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.9tv.co.il/Item/79640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publication on the website of Channel 9 of Israeli television</a> (In Russian)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/viktor.ageyev/posts/pfbid0AzoFkvcVD9ka8bMTDJDAzg3YKU2asgU6Prg13G3QT8Wsm3nzue477pjx4zUqyC5Xl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publication on Facebook</a> (in Russian)</p>",
